WhatsApp contact particle for Gantry 5 (Joomla), using UIkit 3

Hi my name is Jose Olivares, this is my WhatsApps Contact  Gantry 5 particle. Please endorse my skills on Linkedin (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jolivaress/)   You can see an example in this website I made (http://mystudygo.com)



#Installation on Joomla 3.x:

1-Copy the olivares_whatsapp_contact.html.twig and olivares_whatsapp_contact.yaml files to root/templates/TEMPLATE_DIR/custom/particles (if the particles folder does not exist, you have to create it manually)

2-Copy the _olivareswhatsapp.scss file to root/templates/TEMPLATE_DIR/custom/scss (if the scss folder does not exists, you will need to create it manually)

3- Add the following code in your custom.scss file.

	@import "dependencies";
	@import "olivareswhatsapp"; /* Olivares Whatsapp Particle */

  If the custom.scss file does not exists, you will need to create it manually. Also, make sure your custom.scss file has the @import "dependencies"; code at the very top.
